# semantic-alignment-core

semantic-alignment-core provides the foundational infrastructure for registering, discovering, and consuming 
semantic alignments between heterogeneous data systems.

It is the proof-of-concept implementation of my dissertation at the chair of information- and automation systems at 
RWTH Aachen university.

> [!note]
> This project is **not** about finding semantic matches or semantic similarities, it rather requires these as input.
